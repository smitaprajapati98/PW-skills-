    "   - Covariance: Covariance measures the extent and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is calculated by averaging the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. The value of covariance is not standardized and can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance indicates a positive relationship, a negative covariance indicates a negative relationship, and a covariance of zero indicates no linear relationship.\n",

    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "1. Range: Outliers can substantially impact the range, as it is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values. If an outlier is present, it can significantly increase or decrease the range, resulting in an overestimated or underestimated spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can have a strong effect on variance and standard deviation, as these measures are based on the squared deviations from the mean. Outliers with large deviations can increase the sum of squared deviations, leading to an inflated variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following dataset representing the ages of a group of people:\n",
    "[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 100]\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, the value 100 is an outlier, significantly deviating from the other values. Let's see how it affects the measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean: The presence of the outlier increases the mean, resulting in an inflated estimate of the central tendency.\n",
    "- Median: The median is not affected by the outlier since it represents the middle value. It remains unaffected.\n",
    "- Mode: The mode is not affected by the outlier as it represents the most frequently occurring value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: The range is substantially affected by the outlier, as it increases the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "- Variance and Standard Deviation: The outlier greatly influences the variance and standard deviation, as it contributes to a larger sum of squared deviations from the mean, resulting in an inflated estimate of the spread.\n"
